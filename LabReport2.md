> ## Methods from my code

> `Server.start(int port, new Handler())`;
-   Arguments: integer value for which port to listen on, Handler object
-   No values changed as this function just starts a server on the local computer
> Default Constructor for `Handler` class
-   Arguments: none
-   The `String chatHistory` is created, which will be used to add the formatted message onto the webpage
> `handleRequest(URI url)` from `Handler` class
-   Arguments: `URI url` 
-   If the proper path is provided, updates `String chatHistory` with the formatted message to be printed onto the webpage
> `main(String[] args)` from `ChatServer`
-   Arguments: `String[] args`, specifically an Integer to be parsed into being the port number
-   Updates `port` with the number passed in, provided a valid number for the computer to be listening on is provided

> ## Other methods executed

> `getPath()`
-   Arguments: none
-   Updates no variable directly as it checks if the url's path contains specific keywords to return the correct page.
> `getQuery()`
-   Arguments: none
-   Updates no variable directly, but returns the query string (after the `?`) to be placed into the main `parameters String array`, which is later split into other arrays.

## Part 2


## Part 3

I learned a great deal in Week 3 that I had not known in prior weeks. The best examples of these are the new commands we were introduced to, namely `scp`, `-cp`, `mkdir`, and `man`, and some of their syntax, uses, etc. Another important lesson was on the testingâ€“although I was keen on the importance of tests, the lecture in class gave me an example of why it is important to write different and patterned tests, noticing where some of them fall short of truly checking the code. I also fully understood what makes an absolute path and a relative path different, and which are more useful in which scenarios.
